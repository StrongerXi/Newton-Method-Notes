This script attempts to compare the convergence rate of Newton’s Method and Binary Search.
It’s interesting to see how Newton’s Method is way faster than binary search in some cases; while for specific functions it is actually slower.

The Mathematical reasoning behind this phenomenon could be explained by using the proof for Newton’s Method Convergence provided in the PDF which I found online.(Credits to Michael Overton, NYC.)
